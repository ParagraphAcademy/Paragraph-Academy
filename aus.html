        <h2>Australia’s Education System Explained</h2>
        <p>The Australian tertiary system includes universities, vocational education and training (VET) providers, and private colleges. Universities offer undergraduate (bachelor’s), postgraduate (master’s, PhD), and research degrees. VET focuses on practical skills with certificates and diplomas that are highly respected by industry.</p>
        <p>Degrees are accredited and regulated by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), ensuring quality and transferability.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bachelor’s degrees:</strong> 3–4 years full-time (some professional degrees longer)</li>
          <li><strong>Master’s degrees:</strong> 1–2 years (coursework, research, or mixed)</li>
          <li><strong>PhD:</strong> 3–4 years research degree</li>
          <li><strong>VET qualifications:</strong> Certificates I–IV, Diplomas, Advanced Diplomas</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Pro tip: Check whether your degree is CRICOS-registered if you need a student visa.</p>
